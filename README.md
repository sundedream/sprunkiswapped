## What is Sprunki Swapped?

Sprunki Swapped is an adventure puzzle game where players take on the roles of two main characters, Sprunki and Swapped.

The game is set in a vibrant, magical world filled with secrets, treasures, and surprises. Your goal is to guide Sprunki and Swapped through various levels, solving puzzles, defeating enemies, and collecting rewards along the way.

## The Storyline

The game begins in the peaceful land of Lumina, where Sprunki and Swapped live happily. One day, an evil sorcerer named Malvaron casts a spell that swaps their abilities. Sprunki, who was once a master of speed, now has the power of strength, while Swapped, who was strong, now has the power of speed. To restore balance to their world, they must embark on a journey to find the magical Crystal of Lumina, which can reverse the spell.

Throughout their adventure, Sprunki and Swapped will travel through different lands, such as the Enchanted Forest, the Crystal Caves, and the Cloudy Peaks. Each land has its own unique challenges and puzzles that require the characters to work together using their swapped abilities. Along the way, theyâ€™ll meet friendly creatures who will help them, as well as dangerous enemies who will try to stop them.
